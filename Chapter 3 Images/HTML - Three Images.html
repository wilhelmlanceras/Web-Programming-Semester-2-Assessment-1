            <h2>Double Trouble, Double Love</h2>
            <p>A perfect pair-different but inseparable. Tutong’s relaxed affection meets Bahaw’s playful but cautious nature, creating a balance only they understand. Whether curled up close or playfully swatting at each other, their bond is unshakable.</p>

            <h2>Soft Eyes, Warm Heart</h2>
            <p>Tutong wears his love openly. Always close, always leaning in, he craves connection without hesitation. Whether he’s pressing against you or lounging nearby, his clingy yet laid-back nature makes him impossible to resist.</p>

            <h2>Shy Eyes, Playful Paws</h2>
            <p>Reserved but full of energy, Bahaw is a mix of curiosity and caution. She watches from a distance, playful yet hesitant-until she’s comfortable. Then, the real Bahaw comes alive, a loving shadow to those she trusts the most.</p>
